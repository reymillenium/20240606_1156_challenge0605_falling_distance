## Title: Falling Distance

### Exercise Description:

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:

d = 1/2 ùëî ùë°<sup>2</sup>

The variables in the formula are as follows: _d_ is the distance in meters, _g_ is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and _t_ is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.

Write a function named `fallingDistance` that accepts an object‚Äôs falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the
values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name


Process finished with exit code 0
reinier@reinier % 
```
